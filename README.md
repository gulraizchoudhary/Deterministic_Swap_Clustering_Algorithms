# Deterministic Swap Clustering Algorithms
Implementation of deterministic swap algorithms using different centroid swapping strategies. It is important to find the strength of these strategies in different situations. I have implemented the following strategies. I will add the examples later.
- RS: Random removal, random addition
- RD: Random removal, deterministic addition
- DR: Deterministic removal, random addition
- DD: Deterministic removal, deterministic addition
- DDM: deterministic removal, deterministic merge, deterministic addition
